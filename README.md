# Py_PSNODE
General neural ODE and DAE modules for power system dynamic modeling. 

The PyTorch-based ODE solver is developed based on [torchdiffeq](https://github.com/rtqichen/torchdiffeq).

Samples are generated using [Py_PSOPS](https://github.com/xxh0523/Py_PSOPS).

# Environment
-[Windows 7, 8, 10]

-[Linux]

-[Python 3.6, 3.7, 3.8]

# Initialization
1.  Clone / Pull the codes.

2.  Try building neural dynamic models for power system dynamic components such as generator unit, loads, stations, distribution networks, regulators, etc. 

# TODO
1. Add comment.

2. Develop more general modules.
